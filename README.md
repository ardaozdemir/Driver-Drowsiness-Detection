# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

In this project, driver drowsiness detection was done using face detection and CNN. The model was trained using 3000 open eyes and 3000 closed eyes in the MRL Eye Dataset. The model reached 99% accuracy. With the OpenCV library, the driver's face and eyes were detected, then with the CNN model created with Tensorflow and Keras, it was determined whether the eye was open. Drive detected as drowsy after more than 3 seconds off.

Libraries used:

- Tensorflow
- Keras
- Scikit-Learn
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
